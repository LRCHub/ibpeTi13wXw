I used to love to say your name
It'll never sound the same
Foolish pride got in my way
Now, you'll never feel what I meant to say
I wasted every chance you gave
Why do I feel, I'm goin' in circles?
All I can do is wonder why
I should have known, I'd be the hurt one
I've always been bad at goodbyes
Has there ever been a good goodbye?
Foolish lovers just like me
Even lose their memory
For they learn to make believe
Missin' you is pain without a cure
I'd give my life for a minute in yours
Why do I feel, I'm goin' in circles?
All I can do is wonder why
I should have known, I'd be the hurt one
I've always been bad at goodbyes
Has there ever been a good goodbye?
Night after night
I remember days with you
Why, tell me why?
I still keep cryin' over you
Oh, there ain't no way around it
What we once had is through
Why do I feel, I'm goin' in circles?
All I can do is wonder why
I should have known, I'd be the hurt one
'Cause there's never been a good goodbye
There's never been a good goodbye
Oh, whoa, there's no good goodbye
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa
Has there ever been a good goodbye?
